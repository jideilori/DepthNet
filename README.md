# DepthNet

This is an attempt to replicate depthnet as seen in [DeFeat-Net](https://github.com/jspenmar/DeFeat-Net/blob/master/networks/depth_net.py).
Code was orignally implemented in pytorch but i converted it to Tensorflow and trained it on DIODE dataset as seen in this [keras depth estimation example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/depth_estimation/).


# Update ...

* Currently working on improving the ResNet18 implementation.

* Also working on using Nyu_v2 dataset as seen in [DenseDepth](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth).
