# DepthNet

This is an attempt to replicate depthnet as seen in [DeFeat-Net](https://github.com/jspenmar/DeFeat-Net/blob/master/networks/depth_net.py).
Code was orignally implemented in pytorch but i converted it to Tensorflow


# ToDo ...

* Train using Nyuv2 dataset in the cloud.
* Implement PoseNet and FeatNet as seen in the DeFeat-Net
* Currently working on improving the ResNet18 implementation.
